Write a second program that uses the program you wrote for Task 1 to 
demonstrate why I have suggested that you should always use a main() function 
along with the "ifmain" statement. Do not alter your first program.
"""
#As I do this without the ifname import main in task1, everytime a run this program,
#besides importing the function stored in task 1, it is also going to run it... and it 
#is not desirable to run all the functions stored in a module everytime you import it...

import task1
